Source: https://www.uacomps.org/chip

## Overview
The Community Health Initiative-Phoenix (CHIP) is a student-developed and student-directed Service Learning program at UA College of Medicine – Phoenix. The initiative provides various opportunities for medical students to serve the community through:

- Provision of clinical care
- Health education
- Mentoring

The opportunities available focus primarily on **medically uninsured and underserved populations** in the Phoenix area.

CHIP formerly operated under the name **Commitment to Underserved People (CUP)**, founded at UA College of Medicine-Tucson in 1979. The program was recently updated to expand programs that more adequately meet the needs of the Phoenix community.
