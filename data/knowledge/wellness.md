## Overview
The Wellness Program contributes to the well-being and development of all students through mentorship, engagement, and support. It maintains a family-oriented culture through multi-layered mentoring involving physician mentors, resident mentors, and peer mentors who work with students throughout their entire medical education.

The program is designed to keep the community intimate and connected even as enrollment grows. A cornerstone approach pairs students with consistent mentor groups across their full tenure, fostering cohort bonding and inter-class relationships.

## Four Pillars of Wellness
The program is structured around four foundational pillars that guide all programming, seminars, and curriculum:
1. **Physical wellness** — maintaining physical health and activity
2. **Mental/emotional wellness** — psychological well-being, stress management, and resilience
3. **Social wellness** — community, relationships, and belonging
4. **Professional wellness** — identity, purpose, and career development as a physician

## Mentorship Structure

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Physician Mentors** | Faculty providing professional and career guidance |
| **Alumni Resident Mentors** | Recent graduates offering clinical perspective |
| **Wellness Executive Committee** | 5 second-year student leaders overseeing programming |
| **Wellness Committee (Big Sibs)** | 10 second-year student mentors; three assigned per group |
