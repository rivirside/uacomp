## How to Reserve a Room / Space for a Meeting or Event

**Minimum lead time: at least 2 weeks before the event** (the student event checklist says 7 days minimum, but 2 weeks is strongly recommended).

Use **Google Chrome** for the booking system.

### Step-by-Step Room Reservation Process

1. **Check availability**
   - Go to the Astra calendar: https://www.aaiscloud.com/UArizona_UAHS/Default.aspx
   - Navigate to **Calendar → Scheduling Grids** to see which rooms are open on your date/time

2. **Submit the event request**
   - In Astra, go to **Events → Request event** and fill out the form
   - This is the single platform for all room requests — no separate form needed

3. **Wait for confirmation**
   - You'll receive a submission receipt via email
   - Room is not confirmed until you receive the confirmation
